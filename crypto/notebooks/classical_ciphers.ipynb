    "# Classical ciphers\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans have always needed to hide some secrets. Thus, cryptology (1900 BC) is almost as old as writing (3300 BC). Before to be a science related to numbers and advanced mathematics, cryptology was an art. In this section, we are going to study some classical ciphers, which are both very simple but which can provide a first information on how difficult this is to hide some secrets and to protect from attacks.\n",

    "## Caesar cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "The first cipher we can study is Caesar cipher, which was used by the very famous Roman emperor Julius Caesar (12 July 100 BC â€“ 15 March 44 BC). Throughout this section, we are going to present this cipher and see it as a pretext to give an introduction to modular arithmetic.\n",
    "The principle of Caesar cipher is very simple. Each letter in the alphabet is replaced by the letter which is positionned 3 letters after. For instance, 'a' is replaced by 'd', 'b' by 'e'.\n",
    "As an exercise for you, what is the encrypted version of the word 'car'?\n",
    "Indeed, this is 'fdu'. That doesn't mean anything!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation of the Caesar cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a simple implementation of the Caesar cipher.\n",
    "First, from standard Latin alphabet, we build a shifted alphabet that allows us to define a lookup table to have a correspondance between the letters in the plaintext and in the ciphertext."
